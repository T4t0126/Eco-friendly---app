# OLX Clone Chat System

## Overview
This document explains how the chat system works in the OLX Clone application, allowing buyers and sellers to communicate directly without admin interference.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Direct Buyer-Seller Communication**
- Buyers can message sellers about products
- Sellers can reply to buyer messages
- Real-time messaging using WebSocket technology
- Message history persistence in database

### 2. **User Roles**
- **Buyers**: Can view products and send messages to sellers
- **Sellers (Customers)**: Can receive messages and reply to buyers
- **Admin**: Can manage the system but doesn't interfere with chat

### 3. **Navigation & Access**
- **For Sellers**: 
  - Access via sidebar: "My Seller Dashboard" and "My Messages"
  - Direct links from admin dashboard
  - Seller dashboard shows recent messages and product management

## How It Works

### Message Flow
1. **Buyer sends message**:
   - Clicks "Chat Seller" on product page
   - Types message and sends
   - Message stored in `Message` model (buyer → seller)

2. **Seller receives and replies**:
   - Accesses messages via "My Messages" or dashboard
   - Sees all buyers who contacted them
   - Selects buyer and sends reply
   - Reply stored in `PostMessage` model (seller → buyer)

3. **Real-time updates**:
   - WebSocket connections for instant message delivery
   - Messages appear immediately without page refresh
   - Fallback to form submission for database persistence

### Database Models
- **Message**: Stores messages from buyers to sellers
- **PostMessage**: Stores replies from sellers to buyers
- **Buyer**: Buyer user profiles
- **Customer**: Seller user profiles
